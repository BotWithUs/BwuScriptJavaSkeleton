### BotWithUs Java Skeleton
This IntelliJ Gradle project shows you the basic setup to get started scripting with Java. Other IDEs are possible, but this project is an IntelliJ IDEA project.

### Description
- This is an extremely barebones example meant to get you only the bare minimum to start writing a script.
- While you dont have to follow the state structure provided, a suitable alternative is recommended if you dont.

### Info
- You'll find the script itself located at ``src/main/java/net/botwithus/SkeletonScript.java``
- You'll find the graphics context (which allows you to draw UI with ImGui) at ``src/main/java/net/botwithus/SkeletonScriptGraphicsContext.java``
